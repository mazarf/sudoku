sudoku
======

First project for Data Structures. Had nothing to do with data structures.  Winter 2014

This program takes a sudoku puzzle as an input and gives the solutions as an output.
The format is weird.  You need to put all the values for the puzzle on one line with
dots where the blanks should be.  Write this input in a file and redirect that file
as input to the program.
